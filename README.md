Before you read any further, there's a couple quotes that will likely help you understand the rest of this document, and me in general.

> Nate's humor is dry. Nate's humor makes the Sahara look like a tropical paradise
> 

â€” Art Doler (Former Coworker)

> You're not funny
> 

â€” Becci (my wife)

> You always take the hard way, don't you?
> 

â€” My dad

Something else to keep in mind, is that my humor is largely for me. I'm ok if you don't think it's funny, I'm entertained ðŸ¤£

### Influences

Of note in those quotes above, beyond the actual quote, is that those are just regular people. Which is where I've been influenced the most in my life. Every once in a while I'll see some quote or piece of wisdom from someone of note that makes me think or that changes how I live, but I'm who I am today thanks in large part due to my family, former classmates and former co-workers, of whom I'm sure you've never heard of.

For example, I once worked briefly with a man named **Fred Kabel**. He was a software engineer that worked for my dad (oh yeah, I come from an engineering family.) Before he worked for my dad, he worked for [Cray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray) (the supercomputer people) and wrote software for them. He was *really* smart, yet he was a very humble and relatable person. **I learned you can be smart, get things done and not have to show off in the process.**

In high school I also worked at a pharmacy my family had been using since before I was born. The pharmacist was a man by the name of **Craig Leonard**. One time he sat me down and said "Do you see that you're on the clock for 3 hours and it doesn't take 3 hours to do everything you need to do?  I also see that. I did it on purpose. I need to you do your tasks when they're not disrupting the flow of the store."  He taught me that the phrase **if you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean** doesn't apply in professional settings. Do the job right in a way that helps the team.

About 15 years later I was working in IT, writing quoting software for a manufacturing company. Most of my users were internal and one time I went to my friend, and director of IT, **Mike Altamore** and I said, sarcastically, "Don't you just love our users?" To which he said "Yes. Because without them I don't have a job." That comment hit me in the face. I wanted to vent and complain (and he listened when I did) but **he reminded me that I'm not working just to work. I'm working to achieve something. And that "something" benefits a user**.

More recently, I've been influenced by **Melissa Creger** and **Ashleigh Reeker**. Melissa was a salesperson that I teamed up with to try and sell services at a consulting company. In some ways, we were the perfect pair. I brought technical knowledge, and she brought people & sales knowledge. From her I learned **about how to connect with clients and understand what it is they're really after.** And Ashleigh was a program manager at that same company. We talked quite a bit, mostly about personnel issues, and team health. **She really helped me understand not just 1-on-1 dynamics but organizational dynamics.** 

### Strengths

I think the above stories (and the countless others I left out) help illustrate one of my strengths: **connectedness.** In fact, my top 5 strengths according to Gallup's Strengthsfinder are:

1. Harmony â€” I look for consensus. I don't like conflict, I prefer agreement.
2. Restorative â€” I want to figure out what's wrong and fix it, or "restore" it back to how it "should" be
3. Learner â€” I enjoy learning. I'm more of a broad learner than a deep learner. By that, I mean I find a lot of topics interesting. But I'm not your guy if you want to understand the ins-and-outs of something super deep. Don't expect me to explain the JS event loop to you, but know that I know that there is one ðŸ˜‰
4. Input â€” I like to collect information. In fact, Gallup says I "have a need to collect and archive. They may accumulate information, ideas, artifacts or even relationships."
5. Connectedness â€” I see links between things. I don't think there's coincidences. I could talk to you for hours about how my life has been shaped by providence.  I think this is part of why I said I'm not a deep learner on #3. I like to learn about various topics and I will likely find a connection to something else.

### Communication

As far as communication goes, I find it rare that a gif won't do the job.

Although, if that were true, this wouldn't be in text form but would be a series of giphies ðŸ¤·

About the only kind of communication I don't like is a phone call. Video calls are great, slack is great, email is great, texting is great, sharing Instagram reels via DM is great (it's the primary form of communication for my daughter and me.)

More importantly than the method of communication is the act of communicating. Communication is a loop. That means simply speaking (or typing) isn't communication. It needs to be received by the other person as well. 

### My Job

- Advocate â€” I want to help you be **as successful as you want to be**. Success means different things to different people, and it even means different things for the same person at different points of their life. I won't prescribe what success is for you. But once I know what is meaningful for you, I'll advocate for you. I'll let you know about opportunities and I'll do my best to make connections for you to other people.
- Contextualizer â€” There's a lot happening on your project, and in the company, and in your life. I can't do much about the latter, but the first two I will work hard to make sure you've got the context you need. That might mean working with someone from product to understand the roadmap, or it might mean searching down answers for why a particular business decision was made. But I'm a firm believer that people work well when they have context, and so I want to help provide that for you.
- Sounding board â€” Whether it's a technical conversation or a team dynamic, I'd love to hear your ideas.

### Things I hate

- Open door policies
- People as "resources"
